# Cosmonauta.nvim

Neovim custom configuration for macos, Arch Linux and Windows.

The code here is constantly changing and **has NOT**
reached a stable state yet.

Usually it will be fine to copy this repository to `~/.config/nvim` and run `$ nvim` as it is.

## Requirements

- [Neovim HEAD](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master)

## Plugins

![xkcd 2347](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png)

## TODO

- [ ] Add all used plugins and a brief description
- [ ] Add all third party dependencies list
- [ ] Add complete bootstrap (It should resolve itself, no matter if it's Windows, Linux or macos)
